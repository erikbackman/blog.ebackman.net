This is the first of hopefully many posts to come.

I've come to realise that I spend just about as much time thinking about programming as I do
actually programming. I also love sharing these thoughts with other people, unfortunately I often end up rambling as
I try to say everything at once. By starting a blog I hope to convey my thoughts in a more well thought-out manner.
