This is the first of hopefully many posts to come.

I've come to realise that I spend just about as much time thinking about programming as I do
actually programming. I also love sharing these thoughts with other people, unfortunately I often end up rambling as
I try to say everything at once. By starting a blog I hope to convey my thoughts in a more well thought-out manner.

*** Workflow and tools
I love Emacs and think it's an amazing piece of software that prefectly captures
the essence of what free software is all about.

One of the most popular packages for emacs is [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] which is described as:
#+begin_quote
a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and project planning with a
fast and effective plain-text markup language. It also is an authoring system
with unique support for literate programming and reproducible research.
#+end_quote

And so naturally when I decided to start a blog I wanted to use Emacs and Org mode.
There are a few [[https://orgmode.org/tools.html][tools]] available for blogging with Org mode and I ended up going with [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]]
and [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]].

Hugo already has support for Org it is however very limited support and thats
where ox-hugo comes in.
Ox-hugo is an Org exporter backend that exports Org to Hugo-compatible markdown.

So now one might be thinking, why not just use markdown?
The simple answer is: because of Org mode, which is far more feature rich and
powerful than any markdown tool currently available - at least that I know off.

For a more detailed answer please refer to https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/why-ox-hugo/

*A few of my favorite  reasons are:*
- Being able to directly include source code snippets from external files and
  running these snippets using [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Org Babel]]

- Capturing new post ideas as Org Todo entries using [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture.html][Org Capture]] and having them
  be exported once they are marked as being =DONE=.

- Comfortable and distraction free writing experience using [[https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode][writeroom mode]] together with [[https://gitlab.com/jabranham/mixed-pitch][mixed-pitch mode]].

*** AWS CloudFront and Hugo
I decided to host the on AWS using S3, one of the gotchas I encountered was that
CloudFront does not support returning default root objects in subdirectories and
so links like =example.com/posts/hello-world= does not work.
The fix I ended up using was to assign a lambda function to incoming requests
so that requests for paths that end in =/= are rewritten into =/index.html=
