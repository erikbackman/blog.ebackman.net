#+TITLE: About
I am a self-taught programmer currently working at [[https://learningwell.se][LearningWell]] in Sweden.

I would label myself as somewhat of a polyglot programmer, I love learning and getting a new perspective on things.
That said, I strongly prefer functional programming languages and in particular Haskell.
Being an avid Emacs user I also recently started to get more into lisp.

In addition to programming I enjoy reading, listening to podcasts as well as playing board- and card-games.
