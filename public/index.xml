      <description>This is the first of hopefully many posts to come.
I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realise that that I spend just about as much time thinking about programming as I do actually programming. I also love sharing these thoughts with other people, unfortunately I often end up rambling as I try to say everything at once. By starting a blog I hope to convey my thoughts in a more well thought-out manner.</description>
